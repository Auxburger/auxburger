### Hi there 👋
I’m a developer who loves turning ideas into something real — from small side projects to full-scale platforms.

- 💻 I build web apps with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, often mixing in Python or Docker when things get serious.
- ☁️ I enjoy automating, deploying, and making complex setups feel simple.
- 🧠 Sometimes I dive into AI, security, or systems engineering just to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
